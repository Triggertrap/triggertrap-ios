/* What's New in This Version */
"iTunes Connet - What's New in This Version"="All new, all shiny, still red - Triggertrap Mobile 4.0. We’ve completely rewritten the core of our app to improve speed, efficiency, and accuracy. We find those things pretty exciting, but we’ve also been beavering away on new features, including the single most requested feature: night mode.\n\nTo turn Triggertrap Mobile into the perfect companion for photography in the dark, a simple switch lives in the settings section of the app. The colours have been chosen to be subtle yet clear in darkness, and not dazzle you when you use the app, making it ideal for high speed photography in studios, light painting in the garden, and for astrophotography in the field. These colours are designed to work with the screen brightness turned right down, minimising light coming out the phone, and maximising battery life. \n\nBut we’ve not just painted it black. Wearables mode has been taken to the next level, with support for every mode except Press and Hold and Quick Release. This makes it perfect for starting sensor modes from a distance so you don’t accidentally trigger them yourself, keeping your long exposure HDRs sharp and your star trails steady. \n\nAlso, a little something for ND Filter lovers - Timed Release now has our ND Calculator baked right in. In Timed Release simply tap the ND filter icon (the split circle), enter your base shutter speed, your neutral density filter strength and tap to automatically put that value into Timed Release. No more forgotten shutter speeds and fewer taps and swipes. Easy! \n\nTo make sure Timed Release and ND Calculator work reliably together, we have limited the fastest shutter speed to 1/6th second. For anything faster we recommend setting the shutter speed on your camera and using Triggertrap as a cable release.\n\nAnother little tweak to tell you about is for our iOS 9 users, who can now use Spotlight to open features inside the app. Swipe left (or down) on the home screen, type the mode you’re after, and you can be teleported straight in!\n\nAs ever, our bug-crush shoes have also been out in force, stamping out bugs far too numerous (and boring) to mention here.\n\nAny feedback or suggestions? We love to hear what you think, please send us an email to hello@tri.gg to let us know!";
