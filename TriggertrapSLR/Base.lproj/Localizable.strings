/* Triggertrap Timelapse Pro is a new approach to creating awesome timelapses. Connect your device to your camera with a Triggertrap Mobile kit, and you're set to get creative!\n\nTimelapse Pro has a modular approach to timelapse creation, letting you create sequences using the building blocks of timelapses - intervalometers and delays. With these blocks you can create timelapses of all shapes and sizes. Timelapse Pro's intervalometers allow you to set your interval between shots, as well as when you'd like the intervalometer to stop; either by the number of shots or after a set amount of time has passed. */
